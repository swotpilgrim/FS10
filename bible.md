# Bible: Appalachian Shadow

## Story Premise

Ruth Harlan, a PROJECT SLEEPWALKER operative with programmed dissociative episodes, is sent back to West Virginia coal country to eliminate her own grandfather—violent patriarch Caleb "Old Man Winter" who runs Soviet weapons to domestic radicals. Ruth discovers she's already been activated multiple times to kill family members without her knowledge. Now fully conscious of her mission, she must choose whether to accept activation knowing she'll murder her grandfather and never remember doing it. The mission forces her to confront being a weapon with no autonomy—used against her own blood, trapped in her own mind, living with uncertainty about every gap in her memory.

## Heroine Profile

**Ruth Harlan, 29, PROJECT SLEEPWALKER operative.**

Physical: 5'6", lean build from mountain living, dark brown hair usually pulled back, pale complexion, dark circles under eyes from poor sleep. Wears working-class practical—jeans, flannel, work boots. Moves with cautious awareness, constantly scanning environment.

Background: Born and raised in West Virginia coal country. Family controlled by her grandfather Caleb Winter through fear and violence. Worked company store in mining town from age 18—inventory management, bookkeeping, dealing with desperate families living on credit. Developed dissociative episodes in childhood (response to family trauma), would complete complex tasks with no memory afterward. Doctors studied her condition; reports reached PROJECT SLEEPWALKER.

Program: PROJECT SLEEPWALKER recruits operatives with natural dissociative abilities, weaponizes them through induced and controlled dissociative states. Ruth was trained to accept "activation triggers" that shift her into mission personality—cold, efficient, emotionless operator. When deactivated, she returns to normal consciousness with no memory of actions taken. Perfect deniable asset: can't reveal what she doesn't know.

Skills: Compartmentalized operation (can be activated for missions, function perfectly, deactivate with no memory), resistance to interrogation (genuinely doesn't know classified information), high pain tolerance, programmed combat responses, tradecraft basics. Limitations: no control over activations (can be triggered remotely), missing large portions of her own life, dependent on handlers for truth about her actions.

Personality: Quiet, watchful, deeply conflicted. Hates what PROJECT SLEEPWALKER has made her but also finds utility in not carrying psychological burden of her actions. Until this mission, trusted the program's moral judgment. Now realizes she's been weapon against family for years. Speaks with Appalachian mountain cadence—economical, direct, suspicious of authority. Emotionally isolated (can't maintain relationships when she doesn't remember parts of her life).

Voice: First-person psychological horror within men's adventure framework. Internal monologue focused on fragmented identity, missing time, horror of discovering what she's done without remembering. Paranoid about own mind—every gap in memory might be murder. Prose is tight, haunted, working-class direct.

Motivation: Initially duty to program and country. After discovering family murders, shifts to desperate attempt to maintain some autonomy—if she must kill grandfather, she'll do it consciously choosing it, not as hijacked weapon. Wants to leave herself truth even if she won't remember the choice.

## Villain Profile

**Caleb Winter ("Old Man Winter"), 67, Appalachian patriarch and Soviet weapons trafficker.**

Physical: Weathered mountain man, 6'1", still powerful despite age. Gray beard, deep-set eyes, scarred knuckles from decades of enforcing family discipline. Dresses like coal boss—work pants, suspenders, heavy boots. Moves with absolute authority.

Background: Born into poverty in West Virginia hollers. Climbed from nothing to control three counties through coal operations, family loyalty networks, and willingness to use extreme violence. Survived union wars, federal investigations, rival families. Built empire on fear and blood ties. During Cold War, made Soviet connections through radical groups—discovered weapons trafficking was more profitable than coal. Now runs distribution network supplying domestic revolutionaries with Eastern Bloc weapons.

Operations: Controls weapons storage in abandoned mine shafts throughout region. Soviet contacts use back channels (sympathetic radicals, compromised officials) to deliver shipments. Winter distributes to Weather Underground remnants, anti-government militias, radical cells. Profits while destabilizing American institutions. Family members serve as couriers, guards, distributors—all bound by blood loyalty and terror of Old Man Winter's retribution.

Signature M.O.: Enforces family discipline through public beatings at compound gatherings. Family members who betray him disappear into abandoned mines—bodies never found. Uses isolation and mountain terrain as weapons. Anyone who crosses him learns their family suffers consequences.

Personality: Brutal patriarch convinced his cruelty is protection. Sees himself as mountain king defending family from outside world (government, corporations, banks). Paranoid survivor—trusts no one outside blood. Genuinely believes Soviet alliance is practical business, not treason. Zero empathy, total control, deeply respected and feared by family.

Why he's evil: Beats family members as casual discipline, murders anyone who threatens his control, arms domestic terrorists for profit, hides behind family loyalty while using relatives as expendable assets. Protected Ruth as child but also taught her to fear him. His "love" is possession and control.

## Handler & Supporting Characters

**Agent Marcus Webb, 45, PROJECT SLEEPWALKER handler.** CIA career bureaucrat, cold and clinical. Sees Ruth as weapon system, not person. Speaks in operational terminology, shows no empathy for her psychological horror. Loyalty to program and agency absolute—will activate Ruth against her will without hesitation. Thin, precise, wears cheap government suits.

**Sarah Winter, 32, Ruth's cousin.** Works family compound, loyal to Old Man Winter out of fear and lack of options. Suspects Ruth is involved in family disappearances but can't prove it. Represents family Ruth is betraying—innocent, trapped, deserving better than being collateral damage.

**Dr. Emil Kovich, 58, Soviet contact.** Handles weapons logistics through academic cover (visiting professor studying Appalachian labor history). Refined, soft-spoken, European manners. Cartoon evil beneath civility—arranges arms deals while lecturing about workers' struggles. Chain smoker, always calm.

## Setting Details

**Location:** West Virginia coal country, 1978. Mountain hollers, abandoned mines, company towns dying since automation. Appalachian poverty—tar paper shacks, rusted trucks, families living on credit at company stores. Post-industrial decay, environmental devastation from strip mining.

**Key Venues:**

**Winter Compound:** Family patriarch's property in mountain hollow. Main house (two-story, pre-Depression construction, wood stove heat), outbuildings (storage, workshops), family gathering area where discipline is enforced. Isolated, accessed by single dirt road, surrounded by forest. Guard posts at access points. Feels like feudal stronghold.

**Abandoned Mine Shafts:** Network of played-out coal mines throughout region. Shafts sealed by company, forgotten by authorities. Winter uses them for weapons storage (climate-controlled by earth, hidden from surveillance). Dark, claustrophobic, dangerous—unstable timbers, black water pools, methane pockets. Maze-like tunnels where evidence disappears.

**Company Store:** Small mountain town's economic center. Ruth's old workplace—shelves of overpriced goods, credit ledgers tracking family debt, coffee counter where miners gather. Symbol of economic control and working-class struggle. Shabby, dim, smells of coffee and cigarette smoke.

**Mountain Roads:** Twisting two-lane highways, switchbacks, sheer drops. Heavy forest, frequent fog, isolated. Perfect for ambushes, tails, disappearances. CB radio chatter from truckers. Roadside diners, gas stations as information exchanges.

**Operational Geography:** Ruth moves through territory she knows from childhood—uses back roads, hunting trails, knows which families are loyal to grandfather. Surveillance difficult due to terrain and tight-knit community suspicion of outsiders. Information travels through family networks faster than official channels.

**1970s Details:** CB radios primary communication, pay phones for secure calls, physical dead drops. Coal industry dying, unemployment high, families desperate. Post-Vietnam distrust of government. Country music, Pabst Blue Ribbon, wood smoke, economic desperation. Working-class mountain culture—guns normal, outsiders unwelcome, family loyalty absolute until it isn't.

## Mission Parameters

**Official Assignment:** Eliminate Caleb Winter and destroy Soviet weapons distribution network operating through his family organization. Confirm Soviet contacts, document distribution chain, neutralize key family members serving as couriers. Prevent weapons from reaching domestic radical groups.

**Actual Stakes:** Network has already supplied weapons used in attacks on federal buildings, police stations. Soviet intelligence using Winter as test case for arming American dissidents. If successful, model expands nationwide. Stopping Winter prevents escalation into domestic terrorism campaign backed by Eastern Bloc.

**Operational Constraints:** Ruth must approach consciously (handler needs her to gather intelligence before activation), then accept activation for termination phase. No backup—PROJECT SLEEPWALKER operates off-books, deniable. Time pressure: Soviet shipment arriving within two weeks; must eliminate Winter before distribution. Resources limited to what Ruth can access through family connections.

**Mission Complications:** Ruth discovers she's already been activated multiple times against this network—has killed family members over past two years without knowing. Handler lied about her operational history. Grandfather suspects government involvement in disappearances, has increased security. Ruth's conscious knowledge of mission creates emotional resistance that might interfere with activation. She can't trust her own memories, can't verify what handler tells her, can't confirm if previous operations were justified. Mission forces her to choose between family loyalty and duty while knowing she won't remember making choice.

## Spy Paranoia Elements

**Specific Double-Crosses:** Handler has been activating Ruth for two years without her conscious knowledge—she's already murdered family members (cousin, uncle, possibly others). Each "medical episode" might have been PROJECT SLEEPWALKER operation. Handler controls narrative of her own life; she can't verify truth.

**Loyalty Questions:** Ruth can't trust handler (proven liar, willing to use her as weapon against family). Can't trust grandfather (arms trafficker, violent patriarch). Can't trust her own memory (programmed dissociations mean she doesn't know her own actions). Can't even trust herself—activation triggers mean her body can betray her consciousness.

**Mission Layers:** Surface mission: eliminate Soviet weapons network. Actual mission: field test PROJECT SLEEPWALKER's ability to use operatives against own families (ultimate loyalty test). Possible deeper layer: Winter's network being allowed to operate until politically convenient to destroy (Ruth is political tool, not counterintelligence).

**Unclear Agendas:** Is PROJECT SLEEPWALKER legitimate program or rogue operation? Are her activations legally authorized? Was she used for assassinations unrelated to national security? Handler won't answer questions. Program exists in bureaucratic shadows—she has no way to verify anything.

**The Ultimate Paranoia:** Ruth can't trust her own consciousness. Any moment she could be activated, commit acts she'll never remember, wake up days later with blood on her hands. She's prisoner in her own mind. The spy paranoia is internal—her enemy is her own programmed brain.

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

**Narrative Style:** First-person psychological horror within men's adventure framework. Tight, paranoid, fragmented. Ruth's voice is haunted by missing time—refers to gaps in memory, questions what she might have done, discovers evidence of her own actions like reading about stranger.

**Pacing:** Methodical escalation. Acts 1-2 build dread and horror as Ruth uncovers truth about being used. Act 3 shifts to cold efficiency when activated-Ruth takes control (voice changes—becomes clinical, emotionless, mission-focused). Return to haunted voice for aftermath.

**Violence:** Hard and personal when Ruth is conscious (defensive, desperate). Efficient and brutal when activated (professional kills, no hesitation). Graphic but not gratuitous—violence serves story of woman forced to kill family.

**Emotional Register:** Mounting horror, desperate trapped feeling, rage at being weaponized. When activated: emotionless and cold. Aftermath: devastation and permanent uncertainty. Overall tone: grimdark psychological thriller—no happy ending possible.

## Personal Stakes

Ruth risks and loses everything: kills her grandfather (only family member who protected her as child), murders extended family, destroys last connection to home. Even if mission succeeds, she's permanently compromised—can be activated against her will forever, will never know which memories are real, can't maintain relationships or normal life. Her consciousness is not her own. Victory means living as weapon who happens to have self-awareness. The mission costs her humanity—she becomes the thing she feared, and she'll forget choosing it. She's murdering family and losing herself simultaneously.

## Thematic Elements

**What story asks:** Can you have moral agency if you won't remember your choices? Is consent meaningful when you can be overridden? What does it mean to be human if your consciousness can be hijacked?

**Emotional core:** Fragmented identity, loss of autonomy, horror of discovering yourself capable of atrocities you can't remember. Ruth is ghost haunting her own life—observing evidence of her actions without experiencing them.

**What story explores:** The ultimate spy paranoia isn't external (enemy infiltration) but internal (your own mind compromised). Ruth's enemy is herself—or rather, the programmed self that can override conscious self. She's both victim and weapon, murdered and murderer.

**Answer given:** Some weapons have consciousness. It doesn't make them less weapons. Ruth chooses activation knowing she'll forget choosing—attempts to claim agency by accepting loss of agency. It's hollow victory. She'll live knowing every gap in memory might be murder, every day might be her last before next activation. Self-awareness doesn't equal freedom.

## Program Background

PROJECT SLEEPWALKER identified Ruth through medical reports on dissociative episodes sent to CIA research division. Recruiter approached her at age 25—offered training, purpose, chance to serve country using her condition as asset instead of disability. Promised she'd work against foreign threats, never domestic targets, always justified operations.

Training was psychological horror: induced dissociations through sensory deprivation and hypnotic programming, created activation triggers (specific phrases, tones, environmental cues), installed mission personality that overrides conscious self. Ruth endured it believing she was becoming weapon against enemies, not tool for government assassinations.

Program's status: Officially doesn't exist. Deniable CIA operation testing compartmentalized operatives. If exposed, would be terminated and operators discredited as mentally ill. Ruth signed NDAs, psychological evaluations declaring her unstable, pre-written confessions. She's legally non-credible witness to her own abuse.

Her relationship to program: Initially grateful (gave purpose to her condition), now horrified (realizes she's been used for assassinations without consent). Wants to escape but can't—activation triggers are permanent. She's property, not partner. PROJECT SLEEPWALKER owns her mind. This mission is breaking point: being forced to kill family while conscious of it makes her realize she never had autonomy. Even her choice to accept activation is illusion—they'd activate her anyway. She's choosing to pretend she has choice.
